# Architecture

AngKorGit follows Clean Architecture with feature-based folders. Dependencies point inward: UI → application state → domain; the Rust engine is behind a single typed IPC boundary.

## Key decisions

**Tauri v2 + libgit2 (git2-rs).** A native Rust engine gives sub-millisecond status/diff operations and avoids shelling out to `git` for hot paths. `vendored-libgit2` keeps builds hermetic across macOS/Windows/Linux. Every command runs on a blocking thread (`spawn_blocking`) so the UI thread never waits on I/O.

**One typed IPC surface.** `src/core/ipc.ts` is the only place that calls `invoke`. It also ships a deterministic demo backend used when the app runs in a plain browser — this is what makes UI development and Playwright e2e possible without a native build.

**Graph layout in the domain layer.** Lane assignment (`GraphLayout`) is pure TypeScript, incremental, and unit-tested. Feeding page N+1 never changes rows from page N, which keeps the virtualized list stable while history streams in. Rendering is a per-row SVG slice — O(visible rows), regardless of repository size.

**Performance strategy for 100k commits.**
- History is paginated (200 commits per request) via libgit2 revwalk; filters run engine-side.
- `@tanstack/react-virtual` renders only visible rows; rows are `memo`ized.
- Ref decorations are computed once per page in Rust, not per row in JS.
- Diffs load lazily per selected file/commit; images stream as base64 only when an image diff is opened.

**Conflict resolution as data.** Conflicted files are parsed into text/conflict blocks (`parseConflicts`), the resolver mutates block resolutions, and `serializeResolution` writes the result. Unresolved blocks re-emit their markers, so a half-finished session never destroys data.

**AI is an adapter registry.** Features call capabilities (`generateCommitMessage`, `explainConflict`, …) against the `AiProvider` interface. API providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, LM Studio) are created from config; HTTP goes through an injected transport implemented by a Rust proxy (no CORS, keys stay out of webview fetch). The `cli` provider is different: it runs an AI CLI already installed on the machine (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode) as an allowlisted local subprocess via `ai_cli.rs` — the user's own login and quota, no API key. Adding an API provider touches one file; adding a CLI agent touches `cliAgents.ts` plus the `ai_cli.rs` allowlist.

**Credentials are layered, host-scoped, and never global.** App-managed accounts (tokens in the OS keyring under AngKorGit's own service, matched to remotes by host) come first, then SSH agent/keys, then the system `git credential` stack — so a GitLab token is never offered to GitHub. The same philosophy applies to committer identity: profiles apply to a repository's local config only, never the shared global gitconfig other tools fight over.

**Undo/redo as recorded transitions.** Every mutating operation runs through a `tracked()` wrapper that snapshots HEAD before/after. Undo applies the inverse (soft reset for commits, ref restore for branch deletion, …) and validates the repository hasn't moved since — corrupting-the-repo is structurally prevented, and hard-reset-style undos refuse to run over uncommitted work.

**Live updates via a debounced watcher.** A `notify`-based filesystem watcher (400 ms debounce, `.git` noise filtered down to HEAD/refs/index movements) emits a single `repo-changed` event; the frontend refreshes status — or everything, when HEAD moved externally. Editing in an IDE or committing from a terminal reflects in the UI within half a second.

**Verified destructive operations.** Discard (file or all) re-checks status afterwards and reports what could *not* be discarded, so cases libgit2 silently skips (submodule pointer changes) surface as actionable messages instead of silent no-ops.

## Extension points (future features)

- **Plugins** — the command palette, sidebar sections and inspector tabs are list-driven; a plugin host can contribute entries without touching feature internals. The IPC layer is a single object that can be wrapped/instrumented.
- **Forge integrations (GitHub/GitLab/Azure/Bitbucket)** — planned as `packages/forge` with one adapter per provider mirroring the AI registry pattern; PR/issue viewers become new `features/*` folders.
- **Worktrees** — the engine already opens repositories by path; a worktree list command and a repo-switcher entry are the only additions needed.

## Error handling

Rust errors serialize as `{ code, message }` (`AppError`). Codes (`conflict`, `auth`, `non_fast_forward`, …) let the UI offer recovery actions instead of raw library messages. Toasts surface every failed operation; conflict outcomes are warnings, not errors.
